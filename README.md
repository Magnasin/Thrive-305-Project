Thrive305 is the largest public engagement initiative in Miami-Dade County government history. The guiding principle behind Thrive305 is simple – that government works best when it’s driven, informed, and led by the people who it represents.

Thrive305 launched in January 2021 with the following goals:

Strengthen community partners working on behalf of marginalized communities by creating opportunities for collaboration with County government.

Ensure that resident priorities and ideas identified through the Thrive305 process are meaningfully incorporated into the workings of government, including the County’s budget and strategic planning process.

Gather hard data – both qualitative and quantitative – on resident priorities across all Miami-Dade County communities around key policy issues, with a focus on the County’s most pressing challenges.

Empower residents to inform, inspire, and hold County government​ accountable to the residents.
